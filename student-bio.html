				<p class="tab">I am a former Rutgers Student who graduated in May 2015. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Exercise Science with the intentions of becoming a physical therapist. After a friend of mine, who is a web developer, taught me some basic code, I became very interested. I then began coding on Code Academy, which only attracted me to programming more, while my passion toward's physical therapy dwindled. I'm now at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp because I know that a classroom setting will be best for me to grasp the variety of topics involved with coding. </p>
